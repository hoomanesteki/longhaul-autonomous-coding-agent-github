# Runbook

## Start here

Run these from the repo root on a fresh clone. You need `uv`, Docker and `gh`.

```bash
make setup    # uv sync and pre-commit hooks
make up       # local stack via docker compose
make check    # ruff, format check, mypy, unit tests
```

The plan is in `docs/plan/longhaul-build-plan.md`. Story status is in `docs/progress.md`. Working rules for coding agents are in `CLAUDE.md`. Voice rules are in `docs/style.md`.

## Local stack

`make up` starts Postgres with pgvector, Temporal, MinIO, an OpenTelemetry collector, Jaeger, Prometheus and Grafana. To change anything below, copy `.env.example` to `.env` first. Docker Compose and the Python code both read `.env` from the repo root, so they see the same ports and URLs. A variable set in your shell wins over `.env`, and a blank value in `.env` counts as unset.

| Setting | Where | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Host ports | `LH_*_PORT` in `.env` | If another project holds a default port, change it here. For Postgres, Temporal and MinIO also change the matching `LONGHAUL_*` URL or address, because compose and the code read separate variables. |
| Database password | `LH_POSTGRES_PASSWORD` in `.env` | Default `longhaul`. Keep the password inside `LONGHAUL_DATABASE_URL` the same. |
| Config file | `LONGHAUL_CONFIG` | Default `config/longhaul.example.yaml`. |

### Ports and the database password

Every published port is bound to `127.0.0.1`, so other machines on your network cannot reach the database, Temporal or MinIO. Temporal and MinIO have no real authentication, and the Postgres login is a superuser.

Postgres reads its password once, when the `pgdata` volume is first created. To change it later, run `make down` (this deletes the volumes and all data), edit `.env`, then run `make up`.

Loopback binding does not keep out containers. On Docker Desktop a container on the default bridge network can open `host.docker.internal:<port>` and reach a port that is published on `127.0.0.1`. Sandboxes run repo build code with the network on during `setup_command`, so for any run against a real repo set a random `LH_POSTGRES_PASSWORD` (and the same password in `LONGHAUL_DATABASE_URL`). The sandbox environment is an allowlist and never receives either value.

### Migrations and database tests

`make migrate` runs `alembic upgrade head` against `LONGHAUL_DATABASE_URL`, taken from your shell or from `.env`. There is no default URL, so a missing value stops with an error instead of touching a database you did not mean. To migrate another database from Python, set `sqlalchemy.url` on the Alembic `Config`. Code that already runs inside an event loop must instead set `config.attributes["connection"]` to an open connection and call the command from `AsyncConnection.run_sync`, because Alembic cannot start a second loop there.

`make itest` does not use your database for migration tests. They create a database named `longhaul_migtest_<random>` on the same server, run on it and drop it, so a downgrade never touches your rows. The database role needs the `CREATEDB` privilege, which the compose superuser has. If a test run is killed, a `longhaul_migtest_*` database can stay behind. It is safe to drop.

A pooled database connection belongs to the event loop that opened it. Code that runs more than one loop in a process, such as a CLI that calls `asyncio.run` twice or tests that each get their own loop, must `await dispose_engine()` before each loop ends. Code that builds its own engine can pass `pooled=False` to `make_engine` instead.

## Commit attribution

Claude Code adds co-author trailers to commits and pull requests by default. This repo turns that off in `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{"attribution": {"commit": "", "pr": ""}, "includeCoAuthoredBy": false}
```

The `attribution` key is the current setting. The older `includeCoAuthoredBy: false` key was its predecessor. It stays in the file so that older Claude Code versions also leave out the trailer.

## CI

Workflow: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. It runs on pull requests into `dev` and `main`, on pushes to those branches and to `feat/`, `fix/`, `spike/` and `chore/` branches, and by hand. A new push to a pull request cancels the older run. CI has no secrets and always uses the scripted provider. A unit test scans every file in `.github/workflows/` and fails on any use of the `secrets` context, including `secrets['NAME']`, `toJSON(secrets)` and `secrets: inherit`.

| Job | What it does |
|---|---|
| `lint` | `ruff check` and `ruff format --check` |
| `types` | `mypy src`. Strict checks apply to `longhaul.contracts`, `longhaul.durable`, `longhaul.context` and `longhaul.cost` only |
| `unit` | unit tests with coverage, failing under 80 percent; uploads `coverage.xml` |
| `integration` | Postgres with pgvector and MinIO as service containers, a Temporal dev server in Docker, then the integration tests (see "Test markers and `make gate`" below) |
| `security` | gitleaks over the full git history, and `pip-audit` over the locked dependencies |
| `compose` | `docker compose config -q`, so a broken compose file fails |
| `ci` | waits for all the jobs above and fails unless every one succeeded |

The required check is `ci`. Branch protection points at that one name, so a new job must be added to the `needs` list of `ci`. `tests/unit/test_ci_config.py` fails if any job is missing from that list.

The Temporal server in the `integration` job is the image that `docker-compose.yml` uses (`temporalio/temporal:1.5.1`, see ADR-0002), so CI and `make up` run the same server. CI also pins it by digest, because a tag can be moved to other content. When the version in the compose file changes, change the tag and the digest in `ci.yml` too. To find the digest of a new tag, run `docker pull temporalio/temporal:<tag>` and read it from `docker image ls --digests temporalio/temporal`. `tests/unit/test_ci_config.py` fails if the tags differ or the digest is missing.

Dependabot opens its version-update pull requests against `dev` (`target-branch: dev` in `.github/dependabot.yml`), because `main` moves only through phase-gate pull requests. Dependabot reads that file from the default branch, so it starts working after the first gate merge puts the file on `main`. The setting does not cover Dependabot security updates, which open against `main`. If you turn those on, treat one like a hotfix: merge it, then merge `main` back into `dev` the same day (plan section 5.2).

To run the quick jobs on your machine, use `make ci-local`.

### Test markers and `make gate`

Every test carries two markers:

- The layer comes from the directory. `tests/conftest.py` adds it, so `tests/unit` gives `unit`, and `integration`, `e2e`, `chaos`, `live` and `slow` work the same way.
- The phase, `phase0` to `phase9`, names the phase that introduced the test. You write it, for example `pytestmark = [pytest.mark.unit, pytest.mark.phase2]`.

A test with no phase marker, or a test file outside a layer directory, fails collection with a message that names it. Without the phase marker, `make gate PHASE=N` would never run the test. Test files in different layers may share a name, because pytest imports them by path (`--import-mode=importlib`).

Some tests run only on request: `live` (paid model calls), `slow`, and the full `chaos` suite. `make gate`, `make itest`, `make e2e` and the `integration` job all leave them out. `chaos_lite` stays in, because gates run it. To run the others, name the marker, for example `uv run pytest -m slow`.

`make gate PHASE=N` runs `make check`, then pytest with the markers `phase0` to `phaseN`. It stops with an error if `scripts/markers.py` rejects `N`, so a typo cannot select every test.

### Branch protection

To protect `main` and `dev`, run this once as a repo admin with `gh` logged in:

```bash
scripts/protect_branches.sh            # uses the repo of the current checkout
scripts/protect_branches.sh OWNER/REPO # or name it
```

It requires a pull request and an up-to-date `ci` check, and blocks force pushes and deletions.

`enforce_admins` is false on purpose. The owner merges the phase-gate pull requests and the gatekeeper pushes `dev` as the admin, so GitHub has to let admins through. The rules bind collaborators and bots, and they do not bind admins: a direct push to `dev` is rejected for a token without admin rights and accepted for an admin. A fine-grained token that the owner mints acts with the owner's rights, so these rules do not stop it. The branch guard in the agent's own code (invariant I5) is what keeps the agent off the default branch. `tests/unit/test_ci_config.py` pins this value, so changing it means changing this paragraph too.
